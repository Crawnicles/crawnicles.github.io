I have put together many notes over the years on how to write well and that's what I am going to work on today

Before the end of the year I want to have cleaned my shit and donated things, reduced the total number of items and made the house quite clean as well as my notes and bookmarks and all that nonsense - tabs in my phone. I want to feel completely clean. Get rid of all the 'material to review at a later point' type shit. 


Gotta clean 350 notes.....25 tabs....and 25 bookmarks...a whole days project at the moment. Go quickly while the coffee kicks in:

THE WHY BEHIND EVERYTHING IS TO BE MORE FREE

- Get a theme for a book a stick it on the computer and make sure every sentence serves that theme

- Get really clear with what you want to create

- Don't setout to teach the reader, tell an honest story

- Invoke the muse through a lil prayer everyday before you write, that's where ideas come from, do it genuinely


        The prayer is something like:
        Let novelty come through these words, this story
        Let new fresh ideas that others haven't thought of come through me into this work
        Let me do the work that others don't want to do
        Let me delve into the ideas others are afraid to touch



- Let your morning routine fuel the desire to be productive - WORK OUT errday and you'll feel 100 as often as possible

- Write with purpose everyday - don't just sit down to journal anymore. Be willing to give that therapeutic aspect up - work on a project when you sit to write

- When writing and editing - make sure that the tone of each word matches your intention for the writing...is this the way to say it how you feel it?

- Don't be compelled to get more institutional education if you know what you want to do, seek someone out who does it and work with them...I actually want my uncle Barry to be a mentor...ngl. Learn from the people who do it though - look for an author in the twin cities and really attempt to meet them to take up a mentorship

- Get through the entire first draft of a project before worrying about details - write it like diary entries, no concern for the reader

- Be devoted to making the best thing you can make and don't worry about the outcomes during the creation phase

- Submit less to the convenient choice more than you want to

- If you really want to know a character, have them talk about sex and money
