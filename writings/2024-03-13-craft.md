I am fortunate to know a real craft expert. My mother is a master woodcarver and I can see how it's done. Sshe has done it my entire life and has sold thousands of dollars of artwork every year for many years. To me that's a success in a craft. Writing is a different type of craft. I could also be a woodcarver and eventually become a master. I enjoy it to the point that I want to create a wood world in my own home but I don't feel compelled to sell it regularly. My father is a fisherman, and generally an outdoorsman. I feel that in me as well but I don't want to monetize that either. I think that I would like my craft be able to provide for my family. I am going to take the safe route of data science as well as the higher risk route of writing.
