I dreamt of being a professional basketball player as a boy. Then I considered soccer, a sport I was actually good at, but I didn't have the discipline to be top tier. Now I am interested in being a professional knowledge worker and writer.

I believe I have a chance at being exceptional at both of these because I have fewer distractions now than at any other point in my life. 
Furthermore, I have tools and an environment to become more productive than 99.5 % of other people.

Less than .5 % of knowledge workers have experienced a Vipassana course - that's an advantage that I don't feel the need to expand on.
If I am to meditate two hours a day as the course suggests I'll be in the top 0.01% of the trait discipline.

Second, I have fewer distractions than most people my age - I am not reacting to thoughts of passion outside of one woman. I am not generating anger from the outside world. I don't linger on any form of hate. These are all downstream effects of Vipassana because let's be honest, being married doesn't change your thoughts about other women - they still arise, it's a choice to let them pass. I don't engage in social media - I spend less than 30 minutes a week combined on Facebook/Meta, Twitter/X, Snapchat, Instagram, Tik Tok, Reddit - and I aim towards less than 30 minutes a month. The internet still afflicts me - I'll be drawn to a show many people reccomend or to youtube channels or to podcasts and so I haven't elimanated all the distractions. I want to enjoy the internet for 90 minutes everyday because it's that good. That's 1-2 episodes of a show or part of a Kill Tony podcast or a random podcast learning something or gaming with a friend having a conversation. That's the extent that I want to be connected to the internet. 

I don't want to see photos of other people nor read their day to day thoughts. I don't want to know who you are in the digital realm. The only thing I care about is how you interact in real life. 

I want to be a professional knowledge worker - not a minor leaguer - like an intense professional. Lebron has been so good for so long because he does all the things off the court well and a professional knowledge worker needs to do that too.
