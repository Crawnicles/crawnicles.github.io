Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in. Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and explore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing occasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples. Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.

What am I ambitious about making or doing?

Does a mathematical representation of the Source really drive me. The reason to solve the big questions is both because it feels like the language of god and it is important that humans aren't 

I simply want the Source to come through me, I don't need to be the one who connects all the dots. I'm not that ambitious. I'd like to learn as far as I could but understand when I'm getting out of my sphere of competency. I have to accept being of middle intelligence at the moment with the potential to work hard and do the right things. My beauty and intelligence are in the 4-6 range in most categories but have the possibility to be a 9 or 10 someday.
