Be Here Now by Ram Dass provides his for of a Cook Book for a Sacred Life. Many authors have attempted something akin to, “Read these guidelines of life and joy will arise” and many are pragmatic surface level ideas - anyone can find these in a few moments and a smaller percentage will be inspired to make a change and so they’ll work on one of the 'suggestions for success’ take Mitch Horowitz ‘playbook’ - Morning Connection, Sacred Literature, Express Gratitude, Three P.M. Prayer, Choose Kindness, Be Sincere about Personal Goals, Radically Forgive, Say “No” to humiliation - Each can be explored and an actual change can come in your day to day level. All of these techniques towards success are dealing with the physical world by nurturing the spiritual world. Spiritual sustenance is often misrepresented in the west as life hacks or optimization methods. Finding ways to improve your life is one of the paths towards spirituality but we all have to run it at our own pace because we each have to transcend desires. One either lets go of desires or they will take you over. Every day we have the opportunity to stop self-recrimination - “just accept where you are in the here and now and proceed full speed.”

Ram Dass takes from many spiritual traditions and by merging them with the insights of encountering his Guru, he is able to reach beyond the physical plane and talk about different dimensions - the astral plane and the causal plane.  “This manual concerns no more or no less than the living of daily life. At first you “do” sadhana (work on the spiritual plane) within certain time and space boundaries, such as going to church on Sunday mornings, or getting high on Saturday nights, or meditating each morning. Eventually, it turns out that SADHANA IS EVERYTHING YOU DO” and so I get this feeling of being fully committed as one is who works to be an evolved being. The first hurdle is being ready - I found myself ready after having seen God in everything through sacred psychedelic experiences. 

Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you: For everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.” - Jesus

“We are born into the world of nature; our second birth is into the world of spirit” - Bhagavad Gita

The Four Bodhisattva Vows (say three times)

I resolve to become enlightened for the sake of all living beings

I will cut the roots of all delusive passions

I will penetrate the farthest gate of Dharma

I will realize the supreme way of Buddha

Non-attachment takes time. “To become free of attachment means to break the link identifying you with your desires. The desires continue; they are part of the dance of nature…someone doing Sadhana sees clearly that his craving is creating his own veil of illusion - the awareness begins the falling away of worldly desires. 

“When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose. You’re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.” - Bob Dylan

“By letting it go it all gets done

The world is won by those who let it go.

But when you try and try

The world is then beyond the winning” - Tao Te Ching

Transmuting energy - The entire cosmos, at every plane and in every form, is energy. This energy is known as pran. Your body is a form of pran, so is your thought and feeling, an so is light. These forms of pran differ from one another in terms of the rate and amplitude of their vibrations. Solids are pran in a grosser form; light, in a finer form. The finest form of pran, the tiniest quantum of energy, is the Universe…the highest plane of form (as opposed to formless), from which all other planes are derived, is the Clear White Light: a homogeneous light field which inculdes everything. Every quantum of energy is interchangeable with every other one, and there is continous change: continous transformation of energy from one form to another. Thus everything in the universe is interrelated. 

For a person who has broken his identification on the gross physical plane, pran is available to him at a higher vibration. He is able to transform this pran which can come from thoughts, sights, etc. into finer vibrations as before, or into more gross vibrations. Thus, he isable, as was Theresa Neumann, to feed his body directly with Light, alleviating the necessity for taking in food. The sun emits higher vibrational forms of pran which most of us can only use when it has gone through a vibrational step-down through the medium of plants, etc. 

Understanding the first four Chakras

Survival

Sex

Power

Oneness

As you come to understand fully that you will be finished with human suffering when you are living in the fourth chakra (or higher)…Keep converting every relationship into one of compassion…every time you slip into one of the lower chakras, don’t pity yourself or damn yourself. Merely redefine the situation in terms of the fourth chakra.

He describes Pranayama in depth and exercises to try. 

“If you have a desire other than the desire for enlightenment, at each stage of your work you become increasingly capable of gratifying that desire. If you want wealth, wealth will be yours. If you want a beautiful lover, why, a beautiful lover will be yours. The problem of course is that everytime you direct your attention to the gratification of a specific desrire, you create more thoughts about that desire and thus strengthen its hold over you. Thus, you slow down your journey into the light. Since you already realize that the gratification of that desire is going to be finite and ultimately not enough, the new power has in fact sucked you into another cul-de-sac. And so it goes for most people until they truly see each new power as one more seductive enticement of Maya”

A spiritual community will make progression inevitable. “In getting straight, you must re-visit all your old attachments and re-see them in the light of the Spirit.”

“Truth gets you high. There is no doubt about it. Lies bring you down” 

Right Livelihood depends on honest work considering all vectors - social, cultural, economic, hereditary, and experiential factors.

Karma Yoga - Offering every action to a higher consciousness - every act one of waking up. 

“Another systematic technique for introducing an additional focal point is the technique called self-remembering, which utilizes a device called the witness. 

The witness

Who you are in the morning when the alarm goes off is quite different from who you were the night before…and that who you are from moment to moment changes. There’s hundreds of different you’s - sometimes on “you” does something for which all the other “you’s” must pay for years of possibly the rest of your life. Each of these “you’s” reflects and identification with desire, or a feeling, or a thought. If, as we have seen, the work is to break these identifications, we can work effectively throughout each day by making each of these “you’s” objects, i.e., by breaking the identification with each of them. This is not so easy.”
