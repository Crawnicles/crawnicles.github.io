Leaving the house is often a mission. I'm not on any mission - I don't have any goals for the day. I'm observing humans in interesting environments.

The climbing gym yoga studio is bound to be filled with interesting people. The cafe near small businesses, near the graudate student housing is always filled with coffee heads. 

Climbers and Coffeeheads are particularly interesting in the city. 
Regular gym goers are cool -  I think they are the people who drink protein shakes in water - artifical methods of weight gain don't appeal to me. 

I find that there's a developed sense of taste in these places - yoga can be a bit basic at times. Chicks in yoga pants, the hippie type fellas. 

Someone with Baggie jeans and some new balance shoes. Closer to the antoine style vibe when he be stylin. A bit thrifty - playing with the fit a bit. Loose wide cut jeans are back in style. The most durable of pant. Graphic tees are a bit in right now. Tees from shows or parks are what we rock. I like interesting patterns but rarely am I blown away. It's generally a good thrift store find that I am into. Tracy's got that going for her sense of style. She's got different degrees of dressy too. I just have one or two. I'd like to add  a few more options but right now I am the impromptu hike and the business casual which sometimes overlap. Bien is rocking the dirt bag look - same pair of jeans/sweater all winter. I like it. A lot of people with the baggy jeans style also sport this type of laceless hightop shoe. Popular these days - along with platform shoes for chicks. 

Hoka shoes are the shit right now too for athletic types. If I could have a new set of styles it'd be:

Meditation/Pajamas/At home clothes - 
Athletic outdoorsy fit - Hokas, Patagonia Baggies, Mountain Gear tee or a mfing Nike jumpsuit
Public Interest - a graphic tee - niche interest, layered shirt over it, lululemon ABC pant, clean kicks
Fancy - a suit, dope Pakistani fit, high class - sophisticated and simple clean look

Thinking about other lifestyles I hear about and dream about. 

Brady Ross - living fully from a Van, working from a starlink terminal. It'd be tough with a wife ngl. She gotta have somewhere good to pee and shower. He may be able to do it but I have a long way to go before being able to do something like that. The older I get the less likely that lifestyle will be desirable. 

Mike Flynn - Living with a Tacoma and Moto out in Montana with a mountain gal to share life and the outdoors with. Works there I'd guess. 

John Kephart/Bryce Tappen - Both at MIT doing postdoc research in inorganic chemistry. A man with a scientific outlook who has gone through the rigor of getting into a top University has a high degree of respect. 

Dennis - Living a sterile life consumed by the work of fixing up others and making a relationship work. I love this dude for his continued rigor for years on end. 

I have re-evaluated my life based upon the beauty of many other lives. Of course the homies are all doing cool things. All of these lifestyles are a combination of Adventure/Exploration types. I have traveled plenty lately and feel as if it will always be an interest and thrilling but the returns are diminishing of travelling in-country. I have almost seen every state and I have decided what living life to the fullest looks like.

Working towards a specific role restlessly

Intellectual and Creative Lifestyle:

Focusing on Essential Experiences and minimizing possessions

Entrepreneurial Lifestyle:
Single-minded focus day and night ON BUSINESS

Tech and Gaming Lifestyle:
Write some code, play some games. 

Spiritual or Mindfulness Lifestyle:
Meditate, Read and practice peace

I feel as if I want to be the least career oriented, allow the spiritual life to be subtle, live somewhat minimalist but not all out, prioritize who I spend the social life with, keep gaming and working in tech, create more disicipline around health and fitness, keep adventuring and always having a trip I'm working out for, nearly at the top - engage in wriitng as a devotion to love practice, and lastly, the highest focus of my life will be outside of what all these people I respect do. I'll engage in the entrepreneurial lifestyle - without being a creator type or parroting advice that is everywhere. I don't want to be an advice guy - I want to be a doer. Wake up and do. Write as a form of balance. Gym - business - write. Lay low this year. 

I've sacrificed a rogue lifestyle to have the balance that a wife brings. It's good for me. I am a bit too much a stoner when I'm alone and just working. I'd get too bored each night and more internet addicted than I find myself now. 

Wanting nice shiiit may look like a lifestyle with taste but I think it's rather that someone has one simple idea and they pursue that with undistracted attention and they are living - not considering how to live. In the process they find things that suit them and they feel good in. They keep doing that which makes them feel good and they create a cycle of doing things that put them in their zone of genius. 

I would be really proud of a life where I make M courts more accessible to me, my community and the world. Basketball may be one of the great joys of my life - sports in general was the focus of my childhood and I feel like that's where I was the most me. I am not academically inclined to devote my life to physics/economics/statistics or any of that nonsense. My path is sorta set and it's a life I could be proud of. 

Tracy is the most important decision in my life but she's not the person to amplify my intellect. I don't need to be the smartest person - I just need to do enough work to be able to communicate with the brightest humans. It'd be hard for me to set out on being an academic to just have an AI develop new knowledge. It'd make the mid-hanging fruit even harder. I've got a great idea and the time has come. I know basketball will be just as popular among kids in 50 years. Guaranteed. It's right work. It's the idea that brought me to building a business. I am in my sphere of competency. I don't need the weight of the world on me by attempting to be Sam Altman big.
