Chogyam Trungpa was introduced to me through multiple podcasts - Tara Brach, Duncan Trussel, and Tim Ferriss all have referenced his work. He was taught in Tibetan Buddhism and was forced to leave Tibet at the age of 20 as China invaded.

Shambhala is a legendary Himalayan kingdom where all beings were enlightened. The book draws inspiration from Eastern pre-industrial societies on principles of sacredness, dignity, and warriorship. “The Shambhala teachings are founded on the premise that there is a basic human wisdom that can help solve the world’s problems.” 

He opens the book with ‘Creating an Enlightened Society’ in which he acknowledges that every human has an ideal for society. The starting place is to learn to not be afraid of yourself. Recognize that you are never off duty as a warrior. With these precepts, one is able to discover what skills they’re encoded with that they can offer to the world. To begin, we observe our experiences without evaluation or bias. If we momentarily shed our identity, the labels we assign ourselves, we can discover ‘basic goodness’ - “the basic goodness of being alive.” 

The book sets out to change your relationship to ordinary life. He offers the path of meditation to discover the basic goodness of the world. Dignity comes from being still and simple - knowing the experience that there is “no fundamental complaint about anything or anyone at all.” The meditation practice is the foundation for holding one’s posture. Maintaining a straight back is showing that you have synchronized your mind and body. Silence and stillness bring one into their heartspace - “such awakened heart comes from being willing to face your state of mind.” 

Fearlessness comes from experiencing fear and knowing genuine sadness - sadness that makes us tender while also opening us to our own bravery. 

Synchronizing Mind and Body is known when there is an absence of doubt that is a result of trusting your heart. Understanding that you belong on the Earth and that is okay to love life opens to door to his concept of The Great Eastern Sun. 

“The way of the Great Eastern Sun is based on seeing that there is a natural source of radiance and brilliance in this world-which is the innate wakefulness of human beings.” He describes this concept as the continual renewal of appreciation for life and this world that helps one develop gentleness. He contrasts the great eastern sun with the setting sun. The setting sun approach is described as people who have money that can order a feast and not keep or eat the leftovers - they leave the job of cleaning up to somebody else because they are above that because of their money. They tend to take on the feeling that they are condemned to their problems.  Cleaning ourselves of the setting sun mindset begins by telling the truth. To become doubtless, we must eliminate hesitation that comes from not being honest. 

He goes on to describe the state that most people live in - the cocoon. The cocoon is the perpetual recreation of habitual patterns of behavior and thought. To come out of the cocoon, we must have sympathy for the darkness everyone experiences. We must take up discipline (meditation) so as not to need to be constantly entertained. The true warrior is “all-victorious, there is nothing to conquer, no fundamental problem or obstacle to overcome.”

Renunciation is making yourself more available, more gentle and open to others. In order to be a warrior, one must feel a sad and tender heart. The warrior is sensitive to every aspect of phenomena. Meditation develops this sense of steady mindedness that allows one to have vast awareness as they are not being lost in the ups and downs of the mind. To overcome selfishness, one must be daring, one must take a leap, and the leap for the warrior is to disown their thoughts and renounce their privacy. When you let yourself go in that way, you develop trust in the strength of your being and trust in your ability to open and extend yourself to others. 

To be a warrior is to be genuine in every moment of your life. “The goal of warriorship is to express basic goodness...training yourself is learning to rest in basic goodness, a complete state of simplicity.” One must overcome temptation to be a warrior, learning to say “no” to genuineness, to say “no” to carelessness or crudeness, to say “no” to lack of wakefulness. 

“Balance comes from making friends with heaven and earth. Earth is gravity, or practicality. Heave is vision. Balance comes from joining practicality with vision.” Trungpa Rinpoche goes on to discuss letting go of doubt and deception. He introduces another potent concept: Windhorse.

“The wind principle is that the energy of basic goodness is strong and exuberant and brilliant. At the same time, basic goodness can be ridden, which is the principle of horse. The warrior fearlessly projects the state once they’ve discovered it within themself. The warrior then begins to understand the state of unconditional confidence. “This is an unconditional state in which you simply possess an unwavering state of mind that needs no reference point.”

Nowness

“You can’t help society purely on the basis of your vision for the nation or the world.” Nowness refers to the state one must exist in to integrate the everyday domestic life with the vision. “We should respect life on that mundane level, because the only way to implement our vision for society is to bring it down to the situation of a single household...Appreciating sacredness begins by taking interest in all details of your life. Interest is simply applying awareness to your everyday life. Nowness is the basis for creating an enlightened society.

Discovering Magic. First one must learn the primordial sense - the state that is unconditioned. Our conditioning - our concepts - our mental patterns - our physical cravings all lead to a mind state that we are closing off the vastness of perception. Seeing a bird and leaving it at that, we’ve utterly passed up the joy of observing the bird as we’ve categorized as something common. “When we draw upon the depth and power of vastness into a single perception, we are discovering magic” or in other words we are seeing the world as it is - not as we have shaped it. Trungpa introduces the Tibetan concept of Drala. Drala is the unconditioned wisdom and power of the world that are beyond any dualism. All wisdom is the wisdom of the cosmic mirror. It is possible to contact energy that is beyond dualism, beyond aggression - energy that is neither for you nor against you. That is the energy of drala. The only way to contact that energy is to experience a gentle state of being in yourself. The only way to experience drala is to manifest bravery. “Bravery is the courage to be - to live in the world without any deception and with tremendous kindness and caring for others.” He lays out three ways to invoke Drala:

External

Internal

Secret

How to Invoke Magic

Drala’s - energy beyond aggression - are ways of being gentle and open. Bravery is being without deception and a prerequisite to invoking Drala:

“External drala is invoking magic in your physical environment. Creating harmony in your environment in order to encourage awareness and attention to detail. The more I limit my material possessions the more at ease I feel and the more focused I am.

 “Internal Drala is the oneness in your body - oneness in the sense that your head, your shoulders, your torso, your arms, your genitals, your knees, your legs, and your toes all hang together as one basically good human body. You invoke internal drala through your relationship to your personal habits, how you handle the details of dressing, eating, drinking, sleeping.”


Secret Drala is the result of combining external and internal drala. Secret Drala is an altered state of consciousness - you have synchronized the environment with your body that you provoke tremendous wakefulness.

Overcoming Arrogance - “When you are fully gentle, without arrogance and without aggression, you see the brilliance of the universe.”

Overcoming Habitual Patterns - “We use our habitual patterns to seal ourselves off and to build up ourselves. Once there was tremendous inquisitiveness - the spirit of the child - habits form the cocoon. 

The four dignities are meek, perky, outrageous, and inscrutable:

Meekness is basically experiencing a humble and gentle state of being

Resting in simplicity, the warrior of meek extends a sense of kindness to himself and mercy to others. Stages of meekness:

Modesty meaning feeling true and genuine

The expression of unconditional confidence

No hesitation, the warrior’s mind is vast

“Perkiness is connected with uplifted and youthful energy. It refers to unconditional cheerfulness which comes from ongoing discipline. The warrior of perky is never caught in the trap of doubt and is always joyful and artful.”

Outrageousness is being daring and entering into situations without hope and fear. In order to overcome fear, it is necessary to overcome hope. 

Inscrutability is the experience of fulfillment and uncontrived spontaneous achievement. The action of inscrutability is to create an environment which contains fearlessness, warmth, and genuineness.

To recognize the basic goodness and develop the dralas and dignities is not enough. A mentor is instrumental in going further.
