Jim Collins Flywheel - to get full power, it’s very helpful to rigorously ask the question. What’s the sequence in our flywheel? A flywheel is an underlying logic that works in the such the following way:



If you do A, you almost can’t help but do B

If you do B, you almost can’t help but do C

If you do C, you almost can’t help but do D

If you do D, you almost can’t help but do A



It’s a momentum machine built by converging complementary skills. 



If you learn, you have to teach

If you teach, you have to write

If you write, you have to sell books

If you sell books, you can’t help but learn 



This is the simple flywheel I intend to use. It points me to writing as a route in the future - where lifestyle is much more free form. I began my financial flywheel and the momentum is enough to keep me alive. Now I can be open to my passion flywheel. Working for a corporation is getting to the point as a child where you can paint within the lines - often necessary practice. To create a masterpiece, you need a blank canvas.

I intend to learn the most as much as I can about technology, engineering, and physics. The scientist who can write a new metaphor for the world provides the most hope for a greater future.

I figured out that I want to be the best scroll seller of all time. Humans can control the brain chemistry to a certain degree and I am wanting the full capabilities of the brain to really learn well and climb as far and further than those who laid the base of knowledge for us. We all have to tear our mental and physical muscles to build them up - the body really is keeping score in the form of energy.
