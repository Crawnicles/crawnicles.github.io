How to deploy (GitHub Pages):
1) Create a repo named `crawnicles.github.io`.
2) Drop ALL files from this zip in the repo root (index.html must be at root).
3) Commit & push. Pages will go live at https://crawnicles.github.io/

@TODOs for you:
- Replace all GitHub `#` links in Projects with your repos.
- Swap placeholder images in /carvings and /carpentry.
- Update contact info if needed (currently using crawnicles@gmail.com).
- Put real resume.pdf at the root to replace the placeholder.
- Add more writings by placing .md files in /writings and listing them in writings/index.json.
